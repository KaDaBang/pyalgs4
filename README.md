# pyalgs4
This is a implement of *Algorithms 4th Edition*(Princeton) by Python3.
## Attention
- Please download the algs4-data package from the [office site](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/), then make sure the directory tree like this:

```
pyalgs4/
|
--algs4-data/
  |
  --1Kints.txt
  |
  --2Kints.txt
  |
  --......
```

- I use ```open('path')``` function as input instead of streams of Linux, so please do not use ```<```  to input data.
   You can run program like this:
```bash
pyalgs4$ python TopM_2.6.py 5 ./algs4-data/tinyBatch.txt
```

## About
According to *Algorithms 4th Edition*, these algorithms are implemented by Java, but I hardly use Java. So I decided to implement these algorithms by Python.

Because of an apparent lack of programming skills, these codes still have to be improved, welcome to submit issues anytime.
